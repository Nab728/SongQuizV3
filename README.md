Now why did I use spotify, why didn't i use a program to check each title in the json file and format it such that it would be 
Artist - Song Title

- Reason so cause I can learn spotify api

- but mainly cause doing that felt kinda boring to do and although it would be more efficient in the long run 

- also big ups to this dude https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vR3m0HupGI for helping me so much with spotify api calls in vanilla javascript
